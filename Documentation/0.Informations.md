## Methods Documentation
All methods and variables have been documented and are available for option+click inspection, just like the SDK classes. This includes an explanation of the methods as well as what their input and output parameters are for. Please raise an issue if you ever feel documentation is confusing or misleading and we will get it fixed up!

<a name="unittest"/>

## Unit Tests
Unit tests were performed on all the major classes in the library for quality assurance.
You can find theses under the "Tests" folder at the top of the library.

Currently SwiftDate has ~90% of code coverage. 

If you ever find a test case that is incomplete, please open an issue so we can get it fixed.

## Linux Compatibility

Since SwiftDate 5.0.13 the package compile successfully on Linux environment with the latest Swift 4.2 snapshot.
However there is potential issue with Calendar's compare to granularity method; to know more follow the [issue #596](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/568) and the radar posted on Swift's group [SR-9101](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9101).
Last Update: 2018-10-28

## Future Plans (ToDo List)

Current plans for 5.5 are:

- [x] 100% Code Coverage
- [x] Support for Recurrences support (rrule)

Any other suggestion is welcomed!

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1+ is required to build SwiftDate.

To integrate SwiftDate into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
pod 'SwiftDate', '~> 5.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate SwiftDate into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "malcommac/SwiftDate" ~> 6.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `SwiftDate.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but SwiftDate does support its use on supported platforms. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding SwiftDate as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate.git", from: "5.0.0")
]
```
