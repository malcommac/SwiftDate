## Create Dates

As we said all methods and properties are available for both NSDate and DateInRegion objects, so you can choose if you need to represent a date in a particular region or you can work with a simple date.

###Create NSDate

SwiftDate provides a number of helper functions to create `NSDate` objects.
The absolute time that is created this way reflects the components in you current time zone and calendar.

#### Create NSDate with components

```swift
// Create a date for XMas Day at midnight
let date1 = NSDate(year: 2015, month: 12, day: 25)

// Create a date at 14:00 on XMas Day
let date2 = NSDate(year: 2015, month: 12, day: 25, hour: 14)

// Same date but using NSDateComponents instance
var components = NSDateComponents()
components.year = 2015
components.month = 12
components.day = 25
let date3 = NSDate

// Create a date for the Monday in week 1 of 2016
// Mind that we assume a European locale setting on the device, so
// Monday is day 1 (in the USA Monday is day 2)
let date4 = NSDate(yearForWeekOfYear: 2016, weekOfYear: 1, weekday: 1)
```

#### Create NSDate from string

Transform a string to a date is pretty easy to:

```swift
// Create date from string
let date1 = "2015-01-05T22:10:55.200Z".toDate(.ISO8601Format(.Extended))
let date2 = "Fri, 09 Sep 2011 15:26:08 +0200".toDate(.RSS)
let date3 = "09 Sep 2011 15:26:08 +0200".toDate(.AltRSS)
let date4 = "22/01/2015".toDate(.Custom("dd/MM/yyyy"))
```

#### Convert an absolute date between regions

if you want to state the time in a different region then just pass a valid Region struct. Resulting NSDate will be adjusted to follow the region choosed.
Mind that the region info is NOT incapsulated in NSDate objects. Returned object still a date in absolute time adjusted to the region and it may differs from the local time.

```swift
let newYork = Region(timeZoneName: TimeZoneName.AmericaNewYork)
let date1 = NSDate(year: 2015, month: 12, day: 25, region: newYork)
```

### Create DateInRegion

#### Create DateInRegion instances

So far NSDate and DateInRegion look pretty much equivalent: you can create it using the same methods:

```swift
// Create a local date for XMas Day at midnight
let date1 = DateInRegion(year: 2015, month: 12, day: 25)

// Create a local date at 14:00 on XMas Day
let date2 = DateInRegion(year: 2015, month: 12, day: 25, hour: 14)

// Create a date for the Monday in week 1 of 2016 in Rome
let rome = Region(timeZoneName: TimeZoneName.EuropeRome, localeName: LocaleName.ItalianItaly)
let date3 = DateInRegion(yearForWeekOfYear: 2016, weekOfYear: 1, weekday: 1, region: rome)
```

#### Create DateInRegion from NSDate or another DateInRegion

You can convert an existing NSDate to instance to a custom region by using inRegion() method:

```swift
// Create a DateInRegion from an `NSDate` by specify a custom Region
let date6 = nsdateObject.inRegion(rome)
// Move a DateInRegion to another DateInRegion by passing a custom Region
let nyDate = anotherDateInRegion.inRegion(newYorkRegion)
```

### Region object

Region is a struct you can use to encapsulate the information about locale (NSLocale), timezone (NSTimeZone) and calendar (NSCalendar) and it's used along with DateInRegion to create an NSDate for a particular geographic region.

![SwiftDate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/develop/Documentation/DateInRegion.png)

You can create Region and share them in your codebase as you need. Region are immutable objects. If you want to use a single Region instance inside your app you can set the defaultRegion (by default defaultRegion is a Region which has the current's device locale,calendar and timezone).

```swift
// Create local region (current device's locale/calendar/timezone)
let localRegion = Region()
let localRegion = Region.defaultRegion // if not changed

// Create a region with Hebrew calendar
let thisRegion = Region(calendarName: CalendarName.Hebrew)
// Create a region for Rome using Gregorian calendar and NSLocale.currentLocale (all init params are optional)
let romeRegion = Region(calendarName: CalendarName.Gregorian, timeZoneName: TimeZoneName.EuropeRome)
// Create a region for China using Buddhist calendar
let chinaRegion = Region(calendarName: .Buddhist, timeZoneName: .AsiaShanghai)
// Create a region for Rome using current NSTimeZone and NSCalendar instances
let romeRegion = Region(calendar: NSCalendar(identifier: NSCalendarIdentifierGregorian), timeZone: NSTimeZone(name: "Europe/Rome"))
```

#### TimeZoneName, CalendarName and LocaleName

In order to avoid fragile strings to identify time zones, calendars and locales, SwiftDate allows you to use dot notation to easily create objects without remembering identifiers

You can still get instances of `NSCalendar` from `CalendarName` by calling the `.calendar` property. In the same way, using `.timeZone` you can get an `NSTimeZone` instance from a `TimeZoneName` structure and `.locale` return `NSLocale` instance from a `LocaleName` structure.

In addition, you can use the plain identifier string if you want.

*Please note: time zone names are the official names from IANA. They can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)*

```swift
// Create a region with a Gregorian calendar, all three lines will render the same calendar
let gregorian1 = Region(calendarName: CalendarName.Gregorian)
let gregorian3 = Region(calendar: NSCalendar(calendarIdentifier: NSCalendarIdentifierGregorian))

// Create a region with an Islamic Civil calendar, all three lines will render the same calendar
let islamic1 = Region(calendarName: CalendarName.IslamicCivil)
let islamic3 = Region(calendar: NSCalendar(calendarIdentifier: NSCalendarIdentifierIslamicCivil))

// Create a region with the time zone for Eastern Standard Time (New York time)
let newYork1 = Region(timeZoneName: TimeZoneName.AmericaNewYork)
let newYork3 = Region(timeZone: NSTimeZone(name:"America/New_York"))

// Create a region with the time zone for UTC (Universal Standard time)
let utc1 = Region(timeZoneRegion: TimeZoneNames.UTC)
let utc3 = Region(NSTimeZone(name: "etc/UTC"))
```

### Chaining Time Units

Apart from using components in the regular initialisers, you can compose a time by chaining its components `nanoseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, year`

```swift
// Create an `NSDate` object for 20:10 on XMas Day for the local calendar and time zone
let date = (2015.years | 12.months | 25.days | 20.hours | 10.minutes)

// Convert this to a `DateInRegion` object for New York (will be 8h earlier in New York)
let dateinNewYork = date.inRegion(newYork)

// ...or Dubai (will be 2h later in Dubai)
let dateinDubai = date.inRegion(dubai)
```

### Create NSDate from time intervals

By creating a date with an interval from a specified date using fromNow/ago:

```swift
let date = 5.days.fromNow // an `NSDate` 5 days after the current date/time
let date = 4.hours.ago // an `NSDate` 4 hours before the current date/time
let date = (5.days + 2.hours - 15.minutes).fromNow // an `NSDate` 5d,2h,15m after the current date/time
let date = (6.days + 2.hours).fromDate(anotherDate) // an `NSDate` 6 days and 2 hours after a specified date
let date = (6.hours + 2.minutes).fromNow(region: inRome)
// ... you can also create DateInRegion using .inRegion()
let inNY = date.inRegion(nyRegion)
```

### Create Dates at start/end unit of time

You can also create an NSDate at the start or end of a particular datetime unit expressed with NSCalendarUnit.

```swift
// Suppose we have anotherDate = Dec 13 2015 at 14:20:00 UTC.
// To get a `NSDate` at the start of the month (december) we can use:
let sMonth = anotherDate.startOf(.Month) // 2015-12-01 00:00:00 UTC

// The same behaviour can be obtained using endOf() method.
// In this example we get the last moment of the current hour from our date
let sMonth = anotherDate.endOf(.Hour) // 2015-12-01 14:59:59 UTC

// We can also express it in another timezone
// Suppose region = DateRegion(tzType: TimeZoneNames.Europe.Rome)
let sMonthInRome = anotherDate.startOf(.Month, inRegion: region) // 2015-11-30 23:00:00 UTC or 2015-12-01 00:00:00 GMT+1/Rome
```

### Date Formatting Patterns

Formatting tokens are the same used by Foundation classes (since OSX 10.8 and iOS6 it uses [Unicode tr35-25](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-25.html#Date_Format_Patterns) specs). This is the summary table summary table:

| FIELD        | SYMBOL | NO.   | EXAMPLE                         | DESC                                     |
| ------------ | ------ | ----- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **era**      | G      | 1...3 | AD                              | Era                                      |
|              |        | 4     | Anno Domini                     |                                          |
|              |        | 5     | A                               |                                          |
| **year**     | y      | 1..n  | 1996                            | Year. Normally the length specifies the padding, but for two letters it also specifies the max length. |
|              | Y      | 1..n  | 1997                            | Year (in “Week of Year” based calendars). Normally the length specifies the padding, but for two letters it also specifies the maximum length. This year designation is used in ISO year-week calendar as defined by ISO 8601, but can be used in non-Gregorian based calendar systems where week date processing is desired. May not always be the same value as calendar year. |
|              | u      | 1..n  | 4601                            | Extended year. This is a single number designating the year of this calendar system, encompassing all supra-year fields. For example, for the Julian calendar system, year numbers are positive, with an era of BCE or CE. An extended year value for the Julian calendar system assigns positive values to CE years and negative values to BCE years, with 1 BCE being year 0. |
|              | U      | 1..3  | 甲子                              | Cyclic year name. Calendars such as the Chinese lunar calendar (and related calendars) and the Hindu calendars use 60-year cycles of year names. Use one through three letters for the abbreviated name, four for the full name, or five for the narrow name (currently the data only provides abbreviated names, which will be used for all requested name widths). If the calendar does not provide cyclic year name data, or if the year value to be formatted is out of the range of years for which cyclic name data is provided, then numeric formatting is used (behaves like ‘y’). |
|              |        | 4     | (currently also 甲子)             |                                          |
|              |        | 5     | (currently also 甲子)             |                                          |
| **quarter**  | Q      | 1..2  | Q2                              | Quarter – Use one or two for the numerical quarter, three for the abbreviation, or four for the full name. |

First, it demarcates days at local zone midnight, rather than noon GMT. Second, it is a local number; that is, it depends on the local time zone. It can be thought of as a single number that encompasses all the date-related fields. |
| **week day** | E      | 1..3  | Tues                            | Day of week – Use one through three letters for the short day, or four for the full name, five for the narrow name, or six for the short name. |
