We really ♥ Swift and we think that dates and timezones management should be painless: this is the reason we made SwiftDate, probably the best way to manage date and time in Swift.

Choose SwiftDate for your next project, or migrate over your existing projects—you'll be happy you did!

## Main features
Here's a highlight of the main features you can find in SwiftDate:

* **Simple math operations with dates!** Example: `aDate + 2.weeks + 1.hour or (1.year - 2.hours + 16.minutes).fromNow()`
* **Easy conversions to and from timezone, locale and calendar**. Use the helper class `DateInRegion` and perform conversions with components and operations!
* **Compare dates with math operators** `<,>,==,<=,>=`. For example, you can do `aDate1 >= aDate2 or aDate1.isIn(anotherDate,.day)`
* **Easily work with time components**. E.g. `aDateInRegion.day` or `hour`, `minutes` etc. expressed in your favourite timezone!
* **Easy and optimized way to get and transform a date from and to strings**: supports both colloquial (human readable) and fixed formats (**ISO8601, AltRSS, RSS, Extended, .NET and custom string as per Unicode standard**)
* **Express time interval in other time units**; for example `120.seconds.in(.minutes) // 2 minutes`
* **Many shortcuts to get intervals, work with time units, intervals and common date operations** (`isYesterday,isTomorrow,isBefore()`...)
* ... [many many other shiny things!](http://malcommac.github.io/SwiftDate)

## Installation

SwiftDate supports multiple methods for installing the library in a project.

## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like SwiftDate in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.0.1+ is required to build SwiftDate 4+ (along with Swift 3 and Xcode 8).

#### Podfile

- **Swift 4.x**: >= 4.4.0 [Download here](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/releases/tag/4.4.0).
- **Swift 3.x**: Latest compatible version is 4.3.0 [Download here](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/releases/tag/4.3.0)
- **Swift 2.3**: Latest compatible version is 3.0.9 on [swift_23 branch](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/tree/feature/swift_23)

To integrate SwiftDate into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'SwiftDate', '~> <VERSION>'
end
```


Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate SwiftDate into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "malcommac/SwiftDate" ~> <VERSION>
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `SwiftDate.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Requirements

Current version is compatible with:

* Swift 4 or later
* iOS 8 or later
* macOS 10.10 or later
* watchOS 2.0 or later
* tvOS 9.0 or later
* ...and virtually any platform which is compatible with Swift 3 and implements the Swift Foundation Library
